"chucky" is, of course, the application name. 

5000 represents the timeout in millisec-onds before the node is considered down and the application is restarted in the next highest-priority node.

[a@manticore, {b@manticore, c@manticore}] lists the nodes in priority. In this case, a is first in line, followed by either b or c. Nodes defined in a tuple donâ€™t have a priority among themselves. For example, consider the following entry.
